cross-browser extension that manipulates video aspect ratio to fit your entire screen. Take control over cinematic black bars.\nNetflix | Prime Video | Disney+ | Hulu | ESPN | + Many others...","fullDescription":"👋 Introduction\nProven to be working on all major video streaming platforms. If it doesn't work for you, it could be a OS related bug. I am using macOS and before I make claims, I thoroughly test it through all major browsers.\n\n🚀 Features\nThe only extension on the market with functionalities that no other extension in this category possess. \n\n▸ Blazingly fast — injection script that manipulates the video is written in plain JavaScript, has tiny footprint and is very fast.\n▸ Limitless platforms — not limited to any specific video streaming platform. Aims to work everywhere, including embeddable videos.\n▸ Minimal interface — thoughtful design that doesn't get in your way, but provides you with all the necessary options to get the experience you deserve.\n▸ Appearance — automatically applies the appearance that you are using as your system preference. If your system is in dark mode, the extension will be too.\n▸ Cross-browser — available for all major browsers and tested on Chrome & Firefox. It works in all Chromium based browsers as well.\n▸ Internationalization — supports handful of languages, but aiming to support all major languages with the help of the community.\n▸ Keyboard shortcuts — customizable within the browser to avoid conflicts with other extensions. Support for activity and mode toggling.\n▸ Magic touch — Toggle between modes with built-in pinch inwards/outwards on touch screens, trackpads with multi-touch gestures and mouse wheel while holding CTRL key.\n\n🧠 Purpose\nGain power over the video in fullscreen mode. Primarily developed for 34\" ultra-wide screens, but powerful for other smaller or larger screens too. I am currently using it on my Macbook Pro 14\" to get rid of all black bars (horizontally and vertically), previously I used it on ultra-wide monitor.\n\n🙋‍♂️ Usage\nRelatively easy to use, but powerful at its core. Comes with handful of options within small interface and keyboard shortcuts.\n\n▸ Interface – Popup interface that you usually open by clicking on the extension icon, has built-in shortcut to toggle it for an easy access at your fingertips.\n▸ Activity – This option will be enabled by default. To deactivate the features it applies to the video element, toggle the switch.\n▸ Mode – Upscale mode will be enabled by default and only one mode can be active at a time.\n▸ Scale – It works simultaneously with the active mode and can scale the video up or down. The default value is 1 and it means that no scaling will be applied.\n\n🤞 Claims\nIt is working on all globally popular video streaming platforms. Including all embeddable videos.

This webextension tries to extract the final url from the intermediary url and goes there straight away if successful. As an example, try this url:\n\n- www.google.com/chrome/?or-maybe-rather-firefox=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mozilla.org/\n\nPlease give feedback(see below) if you find websites where this fails or where you get redirected in a weird way when this add-on is enabled but not when it's disabled.\n\nSee the add-on's preferences (also available by clicking the toolbar icon) for options.\n\nBy default all URLs but the ones matching a no-skip-urls-list are checked for embedded URLs and redirects are skipped. Depending on the pages visited, this can cause problems. For example a dysfunctional login. The no-skip-urls-list can be edited to avoid these problems. There is also a skip-urls-list mode to avoid this kind of problem altogether. In skip-urls-list mode, all URLs for which redirects should be skipped need to be added to the skip-urls-list manually.\n\nSome websites use multiple url parameters like this:\n\n`www.example.com/page-we-want-to-skip?first=www.want-to-go-here.com&second=www.do-not-care-about-this-url.com`\n\nSkip Redirect does not know which is the right parameter, but you can edit the no-skip-parameter-list. Adding `first` would skip to the URL of `second` and vice versa. Adding both, `first` and `second` would cause no skipping.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n--------------\n\nThis extension does not collect or send data of any kind to third parties.\n\nFeedback\n--------\n\nYou can report bugs or make feature requests on https://github.com/sblask/webextension-skip-redirect\n\nPatches are welcome.","weeklyDownloads":356,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Sebastian Blask","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10503078/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/162/162862.png?modified=1622132286","width":550,"height":175,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/162/162862.jpg?modified=1622132286","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":170,"caption":"The red \"skip\" above the addons' toolbar icon indicates that a skip of a redirect has happened during the last 3 seconds(the delay is configurable in the addons' preferences)."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/162/162858.png?modified=1622132286","width":550,"height":175,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/162/162858.jpg?modified=1622132286","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":170,"caption":"If you hold the mouse pointer above the toolbar icon, details about the original url(the one that got skipped) and the final url are shown."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/162/162864.png?modified=1622132287","width":550,"height":175,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/162/162864.jpg?modified=1622132287","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":170,"caption":"Use the toolbar icon to disable(the icon will light grey as in this picture) and enable the skipping."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5246,"reviewCount":95,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skip-redirect/reviews/","updateDate":1646977894000},{"id":"{b0a674f9-f848-9cfd-0feb-583d211308b0}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2845/2845647-32.png?modified=c704113e","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2845/2845647-64.png?modified=c704113e","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2845/2845647-128.png?modified=c704113e"},"name":"movie-web remastered extension","version":"1.1.4","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4286163/cfu_flix_movie_web_extension-1.1.4.xpi","homepageURL":"https://e-z.bio/pnda","supportURL":"https://326486.xyz/policies/privacy/","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/movie-web-extension/","description":"Enhance your streaming experience with just one click\n\n• Greatly increase the list of sources available.\n• Start using the website without any friction.\n• Enjoy other supported websites or self-hosts.","fullDescription":"Originally made by: movie-web.app\n\nThe 'movie-web extension' is an addon designed to enhance users' immersion into the movie-web alike ecosystem.
